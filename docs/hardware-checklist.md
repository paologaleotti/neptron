# Hardware check list

Emulation cannot verify these checks. Each one needs real hardware, and each one is labelled `needs-hardware`. No result is claimed until a person runs the check and writes the result here. The orchestrator adds the checks of each task when the task merges.

The list is in the order of the work on the bench: first the safety checks, then the self-test, then the checks of each area, and at the end the checks that the bench cannot do yet.

## The bench

- Computer: Intel i3-6100T with Intel HD 530 (i915, capability table entry `intel_gen9`).
- Monitor: Samsung SyncMaster 740s, a 31 kHz PC CRT, through a DisplayPort to VGA bridge. Its preset is `pc_31_120`: 31.4 to 31.6 kHz, 100 to 130 Hz for 200 to 256 lines, 50 to 65 Hz for 400 to 512 lines, no interlace.
- Also needed for some checks: a USB gamepad, a USB keyboard, a flat panel, a second console (SSH or another virtual terminal).

## How to record a result

- Each check has three parts. **Do** is what you do. **Expect** is what a pass looks like. **Record** is what you write down.
- Tick the box only when the check passes. When it fails, leave the box empty, write what you saw under the check, and open a point for the orchestrator.
- Keep these files with each result: the JSON report of the tool, and the output of `dmesg | tail -50` after the run. A photo of the screen helps when the picture is wrong.
- Run every tool as root on a text console, with no X or Wayland. Stop the frontend and the launcher before a tool that opens the DRM device (`neptronctl selftest video`, `kms-spike`, `gles_compare`).

## Safety rules for the 740s

The frontend falls back to its safe default when it has no settings, after two failed boots, and on blind recovery. The safe default is the EDID profile when the monitor gives EDID, and else `generic_15` (15 kHz). A 15 kHz signal is out of range for the 740s. It is deliberate on an unknown display, but do not send it to this monitor.

- Do the check "Find the VGA connector" first. Its result decides the rest:
  - **EDID**: the `edid` file of the connector is not empty. The safe default is the EDID profile, and every check below can run.
  - **No EDID**: the file is empty. Before the frontend starts with the 740s connected, write the preset into `/state/config/global.toml` (`[display]` with `monitor = "pc_31_120"`), and confirm the boot prompt within 10 s; with no confirmation the guard reverts to the safe default. Skip each check marked "Needs EDID", and write "skipped: no EDID through the bridge" under it.
- Keep a hand on the power switch of the monitor. Switch the monitor off at once if it whines, clicks, or shows a rolling or folded picture, and write down what the tool or the frontend showed at that moment.
- A check marked "Needs EDID" can make the frontend fall back to the safe default.

## 1. First boot and safety checks

Do these before the CRT gets a mode that nobody checked on it.

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The image boots on any monitor.**
  - Do: boot the USB image of the x86_64 target with a flat panel connected, not the CRT.
  - Expect: the game list shows.
  - Record: the boot time to the game list, and the connector name in the log of the frontend.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Find the VGA connector.**
  - Do: with the CRT connected through the bridge, run `ls /sys/class/drm/` and `cat /sys/class/drm/card0-*/status`, or `kms-spike --list-connectors`.
  - Expect: one connector of the bridge is connected. It is probably `DP-1`, not `VGA-1`.
  - Record: the connector name, its status, and the size of its `edid` file (0 means that the bridge passes no EDID).
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Check the ranges before the first mode.**
  - Do: `neptronctl selftest video --profile pc_31_120 --connector <name> --report /tmp/dry-pc.json`. If the `edid` file is not empty, also `neptronctl selftest video --profile edid --connector <name> --report /tmp/dry-edid.json`.
  - Expect: the dry run sets no mode. It prints the ranges of the profile, the GPU values (table entry `intel_gen9`, pixel clock 25 to 165 MHz, no interlace) and the modes: 240p at 120 Hz (`240p_double_refresh`), 480p, 768x224 at 120 Hz (`super_width_dynamic`) and 1920x224 at 120 Hz (`super_width_fixed`).
  - Record: compare each range with the manual of the 740s. Write down the modes and the EDID profile id (`edid_...`) and its ranges.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The first start on the 740s.**
  - Do: with **EDID**, boot the image with only the CRT connected and no settings file. With **no EDID**, do not boot with no settings: write `pc_31_120` into the settings first (see "Safety rules for the 740s"), boot, and confirm the boot prompt.
  - Expect: with EDID, the frontend uses the EDID profile and shows the game list. With no EDID, it uses `pc_31_120` and shows the game list. No noise comes from the tube.
  - Record: which case it was, what the monitor shows, and which profile the frontend log names.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The output can be turned off.** (C07)
  - Do: in the self-test, or with the frontend, cause a `blank` (the end of `neptronctl selftest video` is a blank).
  - Expect: the CRTC goes inactive, the monitor shows no sync and goes to standby, with no damage.
  - Record: what the monitor shows, and the time to standby.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A stop signal restores the display.**
  - Do: start `neptronctl selftest video ... --i-have-checked-the-monitor pc_31_120` and press Ctrl-C during a mode. Do it again with `kill -TERM <pid>` from a second console, and once with `kill -HUP <pid>`.
  - Expect: the run stops within about 1 s, prints `Stopped: a stop signal came` and `Restore: the output is off`, and exits with 7. The report has `state` `stopped`.
  - Record: the time to the restore, and the `restore` field of the report.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A kill shows what the driver does with no restore.**
  - Do: `kill -KILL <pid>` of `neptronctl` during a mode.
  - Expect: no code of the tool runs. The tube shows the validated test mode with a black picture, or no signal. When the tool closes, the console comes back in its own mode, or the output stays off.
  - Record: what the tube shows, and whether the console came back or the output stayed off. Recover with a switch to another virtual terminal, or run the self-test again.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The self-test refuses while the frontend runs.**
  - Do: with the frontend running (with EDID, or with `pc_31_120` in the settings), run the self-test with the confirmation flag.
  - Expect: exit code 6 and an error that says the frontend answers on the control socket, or that `neptron` or `neptron-launch` runs. No mode changes.
  - Record: the error text.

## 2. The self-test

`neptronctl selftest video` shows one test mode per mode family of the profile, each for 10 seconds, with the kernel's read back and the flip timing. `apps/neptronctl/README.md` describes the report.

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The self-test on `pc_31_120`.**
  - Do: `neptronctl selftest video --profile pc_31_120 --connector <name> --report /tmp/selftest-pc.json --i-have-checked-the-monitor pc_31_120`
  - Expect: each mode shows for 10 s. The white border is visible on all four edges, the cross is at the centre, and the text names the family, the size, the rates and the pixel clock. The monitor holds each mode with no roll, tear or flicker. If the monitor shows its frequencies, 240p and the super widths read about 31.4 kHz at 120 Hz, and 480p about 31.4 kHz at 60 Hz. The tool prints `PASS` for each mode, `Restore: the output is off`, `Result: PASS`, and exits with 0.
  - Record: for each mode, from the report: `readback_equal`, `timing.period_error_ppm`, `timing.implied_pclock_hz` against `request.pclock_hz`, `timing.missed_vblanks` and `timing.flips_per_second_mhz`. For each mode, what the picture showed: how much of the border is hidden, and whether the picture sits off centre.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The self-test on the EDID profile.**
  - Do: if the bridge passes EDID, the same with `--profile edid --i-have-checked-the-monitor <edid id>`.
  - Expect: as for `pc_31_120`. The modes follow from the ranges of the EDID.
  - Record: the modes and the same fields as above.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The clock the hardware makes.**
  - Do: during the self-test, read `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_display_info` from a second console.
  - Expect: the clock of the CRTC is near the requested clock.
  - Record: the clock i915 reports, `implied_pclock_hz` and `request.pclock_hz` for each mode.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **480p and the 2x picture style are stable.** (MVP exit)
  - Do: watch the `480p` mode of the self-test. The `2x` family gives the same mode on this bench.
  - Expect: a stable picture for the full 10 s.
  - Record: stable or not.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **240p at 120 Hz is stable.** (MVP exit)
  - Do: watch the `240p_double_refresh` mode.
  - Expect: a stable picture for the full 10 s.
  - Record: stable or not.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The super-width modes through the bridge.**
  - Do: watch `super_width_dynamic` (768x224) and `super_width_fixed` (1920x224, about 77 MHz).
  - Expect: the bridge passes both clocks, and the picture has the same width in both.
  - Record: stable or not, and any noise on vertical edges.

## 3. Checks by area

### KMS and renderer

#### kms-spike (T21)

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Build the spike.**
  - Do: build on Linux with `cargo build -p kms-spike --features kms` (dev profile).
  - Expect: it builds. The release profile aborts on a panic and skips the restore guard, so do not use it.
  - Record: the commit that was built.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Dry run of the spike.**
  - Do: `kms-spike pc_31_120 --connector <name>`.
  - Expect: the printed ranges match the manual of the 740s. The restore plan is "output off", because the console mode fails `pc_31_120`.
  - Record: the restore plan.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Confirmed run of the spike.**
  - Do: `kms-spike pc_31_120 --connector <name> --i-have-checked-the-monitor`.
  - Expect: for each mode, the border is visible on all four edges, the cross is centred, and the label matches the mode. The monitor's on-screen display shows about 31.4 kHz at 120 Hz for 240p, and 31.4 kHz at 60 Hz for 480p. In the report, `test_commit` and `commit` are ok, and `readback.equals_request` is true. For a progressive mode, `vblank.rate_mhz` is within 1 % of the field rate. At the end, the console comes back in its own mode after the "output off" restore, and the summary shows `restore:` with no `RESTORE FAILED`.
  - Record: for 480i, `rate_mhz` against the field rate and twice the field rate. `flip_cadence` together with `flips.skipped_vblanks`. `implied_pclock_hz` against `requested.pclock_hz` and against `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_display_info`.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A low clock through the bridge.**
  - Do: `kms-spike pc_31_120 --connector <name> --width 320 --allow-low-pclock 10000000 --i-have-checked-the-monitor` (about 12.8 MHz).
  - Expect: the test-only commit passes or fails with a clear error.
  - Record: whether the picture is stable, and what `implied_pclock_hz` reports.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Stop signals of the spike.**
  - Do: Ctrl-C during a mode. Then, from a second console, `kill -TERM <supervisor pid>` during a mode. Then `kill -KILL <worker pid>` during a mode.
  - Expect: Ctrl-C and SIGTERM restore the display within about 1 s.
  - Record: for SIGKILL, what the tube shows (the test mode with a black picture, no signal, or the console). Recover with a VT switch.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The vertical porches of 480p.**
  - Do: show 480p of `pc_31_120` with the spike.
  - Expect: the vertical porches are about 14, 3 and 27 lines (VGA is 10, 2 and 33).
  - Record: whether the picture sits off centre.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Keep the spike's files.**
  - Do: after every run of the spike, save `dmesg | tail -50` and the JSON report.
  - Expect: one pair of files per run.
  - Record: where the files are.

#### KMS backend (T23) and blank (C07)

Run these with the real frontend path (`KmsDisplay::from_env` from the launcher) on the i3-6100T, unless the check names the self-test.

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Open picks the VGA output.**
  - Do: start the frontend with no `display.output` setting (with EDID, or with `pc_31_120` in the settings).
  - Expect: the connector rule picks the VGA output: an analog connector with EDID, or the DP-to-VGA bridge as `DP-n`.
  - Record: the name, the driver, and whether the buffers are linear by the modifier list or by the usage flag (`display.linear_by_modifier` in the self-test report says the same).
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **No modeset before the first commit.**
  - Do: open the display and do not set a mode.
  - Expect: the firmware's mode is still on the wire (i915 inherits it) until the first `set_mode`.
  - Record: what the monitor shows.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Each bench mode.**
  - Do: set 240p at 120 Hz and 480p at 60 Hz of `pc_31_120` (the self-test does it).
  - Expect: the read back equals the request, and the picture shows the full test scene with no offset.
  - Record: the self-test report.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Positive sync on the wire.**
  - Do: set a mode with positive horizontal and vertical sync.
  - Expect: the read back has both polarities positive, and a scope or the monitor's on-screen display shows positive sync.
  - Record: what the scope or the monitor shows.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Connector choice with several outputs.**
  - Do: connect VGA and a digital monitor, with no setting.
  - Expect: a CRT profile picks the analog output and a flat-panel profile the first digital one. A VGA output with no EDID is used only when named.
  - Record: the connector of each case.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The lowest pixel clock.**
  - Do: lower the pixel clock of a 240p mode step by step, with `--allow-low-pclock` in `kms-spike`, then through the backend.
  - Expect: below some clock the test-only commit fails or the monitor loses sync.
  - Record: the lowest clock the test-only commit takes and the lowest the monitor syncs to, against the 25 MHz of the capability table.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Flip timing.**
  - Do: 600 presents with `wait_flip` per progressive mode.
  - Expect: the mean time per vertical blank is within 0.1 % of the mode period.
  - Record: the jitter, the missed vertical blanks, and the pixel clock that the period implies against the requested clock.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A flip that never completes.**
  - Do: this cannot be caused by hand. Run the frontend for 30 minutes.
  - Expect: no `wait_flip` error in the log.
  - Record: the number of `wait_flip` errors.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A late flip.**
  - Do: watch for a flip whose wait times out at 500 ms on the real driver.
  - Expect: the event of the late flip comes on the next `wait_flip`, and `present` and `set_mode` stay busy until then.
  - Record: whether it happened, and the log lines.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Restore at a normal exit.**
  - Do: end the frontend normally.
  - Expect: the plane goes off and the last validated mode stays on the wire, or the output goes off if i915 refuses an active CRTC with no primary plane.
  - Record: which of the two.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Restore after a panic in the release build.**
  - Do: cause an abort in the release build, with the launcher holding the descriptor.
  - Expect: the mode and the last picture stay. The respawned frontend sets the last validated mode again.
  - Record: what the monitor shows during the respawn.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Restore after a kill with no launcher.**
  - Do: kill a frontend that opened the device itself.
  - Expect: i915 keeps the CRTC on with no plane, or switches it off.
  - Record: which of the two.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Set a mode after a blank.** (C07)
  - Do: `blank`, then `set_mode`.
  - Expect: the picture comes back, and the read back equals the request.
  - Record: the read back.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Blank before the first mode.** (C07)
  - Do: `blank` before any `set_mode`.
  - Expect: the mode that i915 inherited from the firmware goes off.
  - Record: what the monitor shows.

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The renderer on Intel HD 530.**
  - Do: run the `gles_compare` program (built by `cargo xtask gles-compare`) on the target.
  - Expect: all nearest and UI scenes are byte-equal, sharp bilinear is within 1 per channel, and the program reports `GL renderer: Mesa Intel(R) HD Graphics 530`. The surfaceless platform finds the render node (`/dev/dri/renderD128`) and does not fall back to software.
  - Record: the program output.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Draw time on a real GPU.**
  - Do: with the KMS backend, draw a 1920x240 super-width frame with sharp bilinear and the UI at 120 Hz.

## 4. Checks the bench cannot do yet

These need a Raspberry Pi 3 or a 15 kHz display (a SCART TV or an arcade monitor). They are not part of the MVP exit.

  - Record: the same fields as on the bench.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The spike with 480i on 15 kHz.**
  - Do: `kms-spike ntsc --connector <name> --allow-low-pclock 6000000 --allow-interlace --modes 240p,480i --i-have-checked-the-monitor`.

  - Record: the result.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Interlace cadence.** (T23, OP-030)
  - Do: in 480i, count the flip events per second.
  - Expect: i915 signals one flip per field (about 59.94 per second) or per frame (about 29.97).
  - Record: the count, and set `flip_per_field` in `data/hardware/matrix.toml` from it.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A Mega Drive game with a whole-kHz clock.** (C09)
  - Do: on a 15 kHz CRT, play a Mega Drive game at 320x224 on `generic_15` (horizontal total 411, was 416).
  - Expect: the picture is centred and has the right width.
  - Record: the position against a console or a test pattern.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Space Invaders on `arcade_15`.** (C02)
  - Do: play it on an arcade monitor.
  - Expect: the mode runs at 16.135 kHz, the picture locks, and the height is correct.
  - Record: the mode in the quick menu.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Donkey Kong unrotated on `arcade_15`.** (C02)
  - Do: play it on an arcade monitor.
  - Expect: the mode runs at 16.181 kHz and the picture locks.
  - Record: what the crop hides.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **A SCART TV.** (MVP exit, not required for the MVP)
  - Do: with a 15 kHz profile, show 288p at 50 Hz, 240p at 60 Hz and 576i.
  - Expect: each mode is stable.
  - Record: the TV model and the result.

### Raspberry Pi 3

- [ ] `needs-hardware` **The renderer on the Pi 3.** (T19)
  - Do: run `gles_compare` on a Raspberry Pi 3B (vc4, Mesa).
  - Expect: highp floats are available in the fragment shader, and `GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` (2048 on vc4) is enough: a 320x240 XRGB8888 frame needs a 1280-texel-wide texture, and a 1920x240 output needs 1920.
  - Record: the program output.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Precision on the Pi 3.** (T19)
  - Do: the same run.
  - Expect: `headless()` passes the highp check (at least 23 bits). Nearest texel addressing at `(x + 0.5) / width` picks the exact byte texel on textures up to 2048. The every-value scenes and the 1920x240 scenes are byte-equal.
  - Record: the program output.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Blank on the Pi 3.** (C07)
  - Do: the three blank checks of the KMS section (blank, set a mode after a blank, blank before the first mode) on vc4.
  - Expect: as on i915.
  - Record: the results.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Audio latency on the Pi 3.** (T17)
  - Do: play a click on a frame, and measure the time from the flip to the sound.
  - Expect: about 53 ms.
  - Record: the measured time.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` **Resampler cost on the Pi 3.** (T17)
  - Do: a release build, and the CPU share of `AudioPipeline::end_frame` with Sinc.
  - Expect: 3 to 4 % of one core.
  - Record: the share. Use Polynomial if it is over budget.

## C08 flat panels

Each check is `needs-hardware`.

- [ ] The bench (DP-to-VGA bridge, SyncMaster 740s). Do: start with `display.monitor = "auto"` and read the display panel. Expect: the CRT path, never the panel path; the limits are 165 MHz and 1920x1200. Record: the `subconnector` value and the profile id.
- [ ] An HDMI 1080p panel on the HD 530. Do: first boot with no settings. Expect: 1920x1080 at 60 Hz under the confirm prompt, the menu at 4x and centred; after a confirmation, the next boot has no prompt. A SNES game is 1194x896, centred, sharp, with black around it. Record: the mode line of the Video block.
- [ ] The same panel, no confirmation. Do: let the prompt time out, then press a button once. Expect: no picture after 10 s, the prompt again after the press, and no further offer in that run.
- [ ] A 4K panel on DisplayPort. Expect: 3840x2160 at 60 Hz. Record: whether the start succeeds and the frame times.
- [ ] A 4K panel on HDMI. Expect: 1920x1080 at 60 Hz with the notice.
- [ ] A 720p TV. Expect: 1280x720, and 50 Hz for a PAL game.
- [ ] An HDMI-to-VGA adapter with its own digital EDID, with a PC monitor behind it, never a 15 kHz tube. Expect: at most two windows of the panel mode, then the safe start. Record: what the monitor shows.

## T28 the PC image on the i3-6100T

Each check is `needs-hardware`. Use the development image first.

- [ ] Do: boot the stick with UEFI, then with legacy BIOS (CSM). Expect: GRUB shows no menu, no console appears, the frontend starts. Record: the time from power-on to the first frame.
- [ ] Do: read the address from `neptron-ip.txt` on the share partition or from the router, then `cargo xtask os ssh --host <address> -- uptime`. Expect: a login with the key; a password login is refused.
- [ ] Do: `cargo xtask os logs --host <address>`. Expect: the binary paths, the guard events and each `mode set` line with its read back. Record: the driver line; it must name the Intel HD Graphics 530 (iris), not llvmpipe.
- [ ] Do: `ls /dev/dri` and read `/sys/class/drm` over SSH. Expect: card0 is i915; no simpledrm and no vkms device.
- [ ] Do: change one line of the code, then `cargo xtask os push --host <address>`. Expect: the log shows the frontend from `/state/hot/bin`. Record: the push time.
- [ ] Do: first boot on a stick larger than the image. Expect: the share partition is made and can be read and written from macOS and Windows. A second boot keeps a file put there.
- [ ] Do: write the image again over the stick with ROMs on it. Expect: the ROMs are still there.
- [ ] Do: cut the power during play, then boot. Expect: the state partition mounts, the guard record and the save are kept.
- [ ] Do: `poweroff` over SSH during a game. Expect: the log ends with the clean stop line, and the save is on the disk.
- [ ] Do: `kill -ABRT` of the frontend over SSH. Expect: the mode stays on the VGA output and the launcher starts the frontend again.
- [ ] Do: check sound on the HDA output, a USB pad and a keyboard. Expect: all work; no key reaches a console.
- [ ] Do: run the self-test with the launcher held (see `os/README.md`). Record: the JSON report.
- [ ] Do: the same self-test on a kernel built with `--no-kernel-15khz`, when that image exists. Record: which modes the unpatched driver refuses (OP-070).


## C11 findings of the first hardware session

- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: boot with the Dell U2724D on DP-1 in standby, `display.output` at `auto`. Expect: the log shows no "cannot open the display" line; it shows "a display answered after N ms" or nothing, and the first picture comes in one start of the frontend. Record: N, and the time from power-on to the first frame.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: boot with no monitor connected, wait 1 minute, then connect the DisplayPort monitor. Expect: the log shows "no connected display after 15000 ms" and the launcher line "found no display; start again in 1000 ms" for each start, with no growing wait; the picture comes within about 16 s of the connection; `/state/video/guard.toml` counts no failed boot. Record: the time from the connection to the first picture.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: on the flat panel, open the quick menu in a game and the display panel. Expect: "Picture style" and "Refresh policy" are grey with "Not used on a flat panel", and accept does nothing on them; the scanline rows still change the picture. Record: a photo of the quick menu.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: boot twice, then `ls /state/cache/mesa` and read the log of the frontend. Expect: the folder holds the Mesa cache files, and no line says that Mesa cannot create its shader cache. Record: `du -sh /state/cache/mesa`, and whether the second start is faster than the first.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: in the development image, bring eth0 up on the Realtek port and read `dmesg | grep -i rtl`. Expect: no "unable to load firmware patch rtl_nic/rtl8168h-2.fw" line. Record: the dmesg lines of r8169.
- [ ] `needs-hardware` Do: read `dmesg | grep -i dmc`. Expect: the line about the missing i915 DMC firmware is still there: the file is not in the image until the owner decides the licence question of a firmware file inside the kernel image. Record: the line.
